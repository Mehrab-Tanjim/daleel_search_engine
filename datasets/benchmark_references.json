    "question": "If during Wudu (ablution), one finds dirt stuck on his fingers, does working on removing the dirt by scrubbing it off disrupt the continuity of the Wudu and require repeating it?",
    "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Continuity would not be disrupted by such an action (according to the most viable opinion) even if his body had dried, because he was delayed due to an action required for his purity. The same is true if he were to move from one faucet to another in search of water.\nHowever, if continuity were disrupted due to an action not related to this, like removing impurity from his clothes, eating or drinking and the like, and the limbs became dry, then he needs to repeat the Wudu.\nFrom the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations .. ?\nFatawa ibn Uthaimeen, 4/145-146 (Dar al-Qutni)\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "question": "                If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and several prayers have passed, what should he do?",
    "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) \n  on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed \n  several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) \n  and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this \n  clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, \n  then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. \n  The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba \n  in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, \n  a translated meaning of which is: \"O' You who believe, do not get approach \n  salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure \n  due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform \n  ghusl\" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with \n  him), in which he said \"I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so \n  I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned \n  this to the Prophet  peace be upon him (or it was \n  mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah  (peace \n  be upon him) said, \"Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just \n  wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, \n  then perform ghusl\"2. \n  This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral \n  discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following \n  Situtations...?\n1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer \n  1/199.\n  2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih \n  by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.",

    "question": "A lawyer in Argentina is asking about the ruling on circumcision for a disbelieving man or woman who wants to enter Islam.",
    "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. \nMale circumcision in Islam\nAs for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth.” [an-Nahl 16:123]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388)\nIs male circumcision mandatory in Islam?\nCircumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it.\nIs circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam?\nIt is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person’s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised .\nWith regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427  .\nI ask Allah to enable you to do all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "question": "If a woman has a miscarriage and has discharge of blood, does she pray?",
    "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? \nThe scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: \n\"If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.\" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) \nIn the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. \nWhereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. \nFor the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy.  (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/292)\nThis is based on the report of ‘Abdullah Bin Mas’ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: \"Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed \" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303)\nLadies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her.\nAs for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: \"What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.\" (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/327)\nReference: “What Should You Do in the Following Situations by Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid.",
