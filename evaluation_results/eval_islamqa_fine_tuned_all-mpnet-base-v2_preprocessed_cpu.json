He wrote to him: To begin with, I enjoin upon you to fear Allah, to be moderate in His Command, to follow the sunnah of His Prophet and to abandon the novelties which the innovators introduced after his Sunnah has been established and they were saved from its trouble ; so stick to Sunnah, for it is for you, if Allah chooses, a protection ; then you should know that any innovation which the people introduced was refuted long before it on the basis of some authority or there was some lesson in it, for the Sunnah was introduced by the people who were conscious of the error, slip, foolishness, and extremism in case of was opposed. So accept for yourself what the people had accepted for themselves, for they had complete knowledge of whatever they were informed, and by penetrating insight they forbade ; they had more strength to disclose the matters, and they were far better by virtue of their merits. If right guidance is what you are following, then you outstriped them to it. And if you say whatever the novelty occurred after them was introduced by those who followed the way other then theirs and disliked them. It is they who actually outstripped, and talked about it sufficiently, and gave a satisfactory explanation for it. Below them there is no place for exhaustiveness, and above them there is no place for elaborating things. Some people shortened the matter more than they had done, and thus they turned away, and some people raised the matter more than they had done, and thus they exaggerated. They were on right guidance between that. You have written asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah. I know what whatever novelty people have brought in, and whatever innovation people have introduced are not more manifest and more established than confession of Divine decree. The ignorant people in pre-Islamic times have mentioned it ; they talked about it in their speeches and in their poetry. They would console themselves for what they lost, and Islam then strengthened it. The Messenger of Allah did not mention it in one or two traditions, but the Muslims heard it from him, and they talked of it from him, and they talked of it during his lifetime and after his death. They did so out of belief and submission to their Lord and thinking themselves weak. There is nothing which is not surrounded by His knowledge, and not counted by His register and not destined by His decree. Despite that, it has been strongly mentioned in His Book: from it they have derived it, and from it they have and so? they also read in it what you read, and they knew its interpretation of which you are ignorant. After that they said: All this is by writing and decreeing. Distress has been written down, and what has been destined will occur ; what Allah wills will surely happen, and what He does not will will not happen. We have no power to harm or benefit ourselves.

What do you think about so-and-so who says, If Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-andsuch person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt sudden action which got established afterwards. Umar became angry and then said, Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of their rights. Abdur-Rahman said, \"I said, O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophets Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place. On that, Umar said, By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver before the people in Medina.\" Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Said bin Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a short while Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to Said bin Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail \"Today Umar will say such a thing as he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph.\" Said denied my statement with astonishment and said, \"What thing do you expect Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?\" In the meantime, Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, \"Now then, I am going to tell you something which has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allahs Apostle did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allahs Book, and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person, who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allahs Book: O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father. Then Allahs Apostle said, Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allahs Slave and His Apostles. I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, By Allah, if Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person. One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed. And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sada. Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, Lets go to these Ansari brothers of ours. So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, O group of Muhajirin! Where are you going? We replied, We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours. They said to us, You shouldnt go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided. I said, By Allah, we will go to them. And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sada. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, Who is that man? They said, He is Sad bin Ubada. I asked, What is wrong with him? They said, He is sick. After we sat for a while, the Ansars speaker said, None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, To proceed, we are Allahs Ansar and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter and depriving us of it. When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, Wait a while. I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, O Ansar! You deserve all is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullahs hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I dont feel at present. And then one of the Ansar said, I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease rubs itself to satisfy the itching, and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you. Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out. He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sad bin Ubada. One of the Ansar said, You have killed Sad bin Ubada. I replied, Allah has killed Sad bin Ubada. Umar added, \"By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us, there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.\"",

I waited for a few days, then he met me and said, It seems that it is not possible for me to marry at present. \" Umar further said, \"I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him, If you wish, I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you.\" Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not say anything to me in reply. I became more angry with him than with Uthman. I waited for a few days and then Allahs Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him. Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply? I said, Yes. Abu Bakr said, Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allahs Apostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allahs Apostle.

She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad on the side of Allahs Messenger. When I became a widow, Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allahs Messenger, sent me the proposal of marriage. Allahs Messenger also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allahs Messenger had said : He who loves me should also love Usama. When Allahs Messenger talked to me, I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Ansar. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently visited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin Abdullah b. Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque congregational prayer. So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allahs Messenger and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allahs Messenger had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these took them the land within the ocean at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that island. There was a beast with long thick hair they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We said: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not. We said: yes. Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants irrigate with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib. He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with them? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Has it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two are prohibited for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allahs Messenger striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account like this? The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him at Medina and Mecca.

So accept for yourself what the people had accepted for themselves, for they had complete knowledge of whatever they were informed, and by penetrating insight they forbade ; they had more strength to disclose the matters, and they were far better by virtue of their merits. If right guidance is what you are following, then you outstriped them to it. And if you say whatever the novelty occurred after them was introduced by those who followed the way other then theirs and disliked them. It is they who actually outstripped, and talked about it sufficiently, and gave a satisfactory explanation for it. Below them there is no place for exhaustiveness, and above them there is no place for elaborating things. Some people shortened the matter more than they had done, and thus they turned away, and some people raised the matter more than they had done, and thus they exaggerated. They were on right guidance between that. You have written asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah.

As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifaah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew!

We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam. When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword. They said: Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it. So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: O my nephew!

They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food. So the Prophet said: I will decide about that. So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Numan and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah and spoke to him, and he said: You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifaah came to me and said: O my nephew! What did you do? So I told him what the Messenger of Allah said to me, so he said: It is from Allah, Whom we seek help. It was not long before the Quran was revealed: Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous. That is Banu Ubairiq. And seek forgiveness from Allah. [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: Most Merciful. That is: If you seek Allahs forgiveness then He will forgive you.

Their saying about Labid; Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you. up to His saying: We shall give him a great reward. \" So when the Quran was revealed, the Messenger of Allah brought the weapon and returned it to Rifaah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam but when I brought it to him, he said: O my nephew! It is for Allahs cause. So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Quran was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sad bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away. \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry.

He kept quiet and did not give me any reply and I became more angry with him than I was with Uthman. Some days later, Allahs Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, \"Perhaps you were angry with me when you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you? I said, Yes. Abu Bakr said, Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Allahs Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of Allahs Apostle, but had he given her up I would surely have accepted her.\"",

            "\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me. Sad bin Muadh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: O Messenger of Allah! Allow me to chop their heads off! Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said : You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads. It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her, O mother! Why do you abuse your son? On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? She stumbled for the third time and said: Let Mistah be ruined! I said to her: O mother! Why do you abuse your son? Upon that she said: By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you. I asked her: Concerning what of my affairs? So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: Has this really happened? She replied: Yes, by Allah! I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah Send me to my fathers house. So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: What has brought you, O daughter? She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her. But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: Does my father know about it? She said Yes. I asked: Does the Messenger of Allah know about it too? She said Yes, the Messenger of Allah also knows about it. Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: What is the matter with her? She said: She has heard what has been said about her. On that Abu Bakr wept and said: I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home. I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough. On that, some of the Prophets Companions spoke harshly to her and said: Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah. Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold. Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman. Later, that man was martyred in Allahs Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah came to me, after he performed the Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: Now then, O Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged, then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers. An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet : Isnt it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? The Messenger of Allah then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: What should I say? Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: What should I say? When my parents did not reply to the Prophet, I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it ; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: She has confessed her guilt. By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Yaqbus name - Yusufs father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe. She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah, and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping from his forehead, and saying: Have the good tidings O Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence. At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: Get up and go to him. I said: By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it.\" Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good. But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allahs Cause. - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. On that, Abu Bakr said: Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us. So he returned to what he had been doing.\"",

By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too.

By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah.

He sent to him a young man so that he should train him. And on his way he found a monk sitting there. He listened to his talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician. He beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast and it blocked the way of the people, and he said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about. He then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial dont give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He for a saw to be brought he placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top but if he refuses to do so, then throw him. So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him. So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk. Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he called the people in an open plain and tied him to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said : He who would not turn back from his religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure for it is the Truth.",

He said: 'It was all exhortations: I am astounded by the one who is certain of death, for how can he rejoice? I am astounded by the one who is certain of the Fire, for how can he laugh? I am astounded by the one who is certain of the divine decree, for how can he strive too hard? I am astounded by the one who sees this world and its vicissitudes, for how can he be at ease with it? I am astounded by the one who is certain of the reckoning tomorrow, for how can he not strive?'",
