A man asked another man to marry his relative to him. He fixed the dower and married her to him. Another kind of marriage was that a man asked his wife when she became pure from menstruation to send fro so and so and have sexual intercourse with him. Her husband kept himself aloof and did not have intercourse with her till It became apparent that she was pregnant from the man who had intercourse with her. When it was manifest that she was pregnant, her husband approached her if he liked. This marriage was called istibda. A third kind of marriage was that a group of people less than ten in number entered upon a woman and had intercourse with her. When she conceived gave birth to a child and a number of days passed after her delivery, she sent for them. No one of them could refuse to attend and they gathered before her. She said to them \"You have realized your affair. I have now given birth to a child. And this is your son. O so and so. She called the name of anyone of them she liked and the child was attributed to him. A fourth kind of marriage was that many people gathered together and entered upon a woman who did not prevent anyone who came to her. They were prostitutes. They hoisted flags at their doors which served as a sign for the one who intended to enter upon them. When she became pregnant and delivered the child, they got together before her and called for the experts of tracing relationship from physical features. They attributed the child to whom they considered and it was given to him. The child was called his son and he could not deny.

The Muslims did not like this condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period even if he was a Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kulthum bint Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Allahs Apostle and she was a young lady then.

I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous answer which was of a great help to our community (all thanks be to Allah). We are still have not purchased a masjid yet.\u00a0 We are considering an older church, with the will of Allah, we will convert it into a masjid and a school.\u00a0 Therefore, we are still collecting donations, which leads to my questions:\r\nOur Imam has been leading the efforts in gathering the donations from local sources and out of town resources.\u00a0 The Imam is on a bi-weekly salary and it is not in his contract to collect donations for the masjid.\u00a0 The Imam has suggested the idea of building or purchasing a masjid, and he also suggested collecting the donations.\u00a0 It has been suggested to us by one of the brothers that the Imam should get a percentage of the donations he collects according to Surah 6 Tawbah #60 \"Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds)\" \u00a0\r\n1. Is the Imam entitled to a percentage of what he collected; if so, what is the percentage. Note that no prior agreement with Imam was established.\r\n2. If a percentage is to be paid, when should this percentage be given to the Imam.\r\n3. If the Imam is not entitled for a percentage, is the board of trustees in the community permitted to give him a reward for his efforts from the money collected.",

The problem is she is the eldest \nin her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-muslim.I have \ntried to convert them to the islamic faith but they refused to submit to islam.As a muslim, \ni respect their decision but will i be doing a sin if they continued to livewith my girlfriend \nand I after we wed.I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion \nas they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not \nkeep idols and dieties in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any \nother chinese) What am i supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and \nshe has submitted to islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her \nparents want her to keep her original name(ie Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?",
