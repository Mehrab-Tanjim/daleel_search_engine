Who is this man in front of you?\" Abu Bakr would say, \"This man shows me the Way,\" One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider persuing them. He said, \"O Allahs Apostle! This is a horse-rider persuing us.\" The Prophet looked behind and said, \"O Allah! Cause him to fall down.\" So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, \"O Allahs Prophet!

Then Allahs Prophet said, \"Which is the nearest of the houses of our Kith and kin?\" Abu Aiyub replied, \"Mine, O Allahs Prophet! This is my house and this is my gate.\" The Prophet said, \"Go and prepare a place for our midday rest.\" Abu Aiyub said, \"Get up with Allahs Blessings.\" So when Allahs Prophet went into the house, Abdullah bin Salaim came and said \"I testify that you are Apostle of Allah and that you have come with the Truth.

The Quraish came out to help their caravan, so they met without an appointment as Allah the Mighty and Sublime, said. By my life, people consider the most honorable of battles of the Messenger of Allah to be that of Badr, but I would not have liked to attend it instead of my oath of allegiance on the night of Al-Aqabah when we took a covenant for Islam. Afterwards, I did not stay behind from the Prophet until the battle of Tabuk, and it was the last of the battles he fought.

He was beaming like the moon beams. When he was happy about a matter he would beam. So I came and said in front of him. He said: Receive glad tidings - O Kab bin Malik - of the best day you have seen since your mother bore you! So I said: O Prophet of Allah! Is it from Allah or from you? He said: From Allah. Then he recited these Ayat: Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin, and the Ansar who followed him in the time of distress, after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated, but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful. [until he reached: Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.] He said: \"And it was about us that was revealed as well: Have Taqwa of Allah, and be with those who are true.\" He said: \"O Prophet of Allah! Part of my repentance is to not say but the truth, and give up all of my wealth as charity for Allah and His Messenger.

I said: So I will keep my share from Al-Khaibar.\" He said: \"So after my acceptance of Islam, Allah did not grant me a greater favor than when I and my two companions told the truth to the Messenger of Allah and we were not among the liars to be ruined like the others were ruined.

They were on right guidance between that. You have written asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah. I know what whatever novelty people have brought in, and whatever innovation people have introduced are not more manifest and more established than confession of Divine decree. The ignorant people in pre-Islamic times have mentioned it ; they talked about it in their speeches and in their poetry. They would console themselves for what they lost, and Islam then strengthened it. The Messenger of Allah did not mention it in one or two traditions, but the Muslims heard it from him, and they talked of it from him, and they talked of it during his lifetime and after his death. They did so out of belief and submission to their Lord and thinking themselves weak. There is nothing which is not surrounded by His knowledge, and not counted by His register and not destined by His decree. Despite that, it has been strongly mentioned in His Book: from it they have derived it, and from it they have and so? they also read in it what you read, and they knew its interpretation of which you are ignorant. After that they said: All this is by writing and decreeing. Distress has been written down, and what has been destined will occur ; what Allah wills will surely happen, and what He does not will will not happen. We have no power to harm or benefit ourselves. Then after that they showed interest and were afraid.",

Behold! All retribution regarding cases of blood during Jahiliyyah are invalid. The first case of blood retribution invalidated among those of Jahiliyyah, is the blood of Al-Harith bin Abdul-Muttalib who was nursed among Banu Laith and killed by Hudhail. Behold! I order you to treat women well, for they are but like captives with you, you have no sovereignty beyond this over them, unless they manifest lewdness. If they do that, then abandon their beds, and beat them with a beating that is not painful. Then if they obey you, then there is no cause for you against them beyond that. Behold! There are rights for you upon your women, and rights for your women upon you. As for your rights upon them,then they are not to allow anyone on your bedding whom you dislike, nor to permit anyone whom you dislike in your homes. Behold!

As regards fasting, he said: The Messenger of Allah used to fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth of Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: \".Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off.and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need. If someone wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day; it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted, revealed: \"The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran. number of other days\". Hence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the month and the traveller was required to atone ; feeding was prescribed for the old man and woman who were unable to fast. : The companion Sirmah, came after finishing his days work.and he narrated the rest of the tradition.",

So the people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, O Allah! around us and not on us. So the clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.\"",

            "The Messenger of Allah came out in the year of al-Hudaibbiyyah with over ten hundreds of Companions and when he came to Dhu al Hulaifah. He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-KhuzaI came, and Urwah bin Masud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet. Whenever he spoke to the Prophet, he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shubah was standing beside the Prophet.He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He struck his hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shubah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shubah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came and embraced Islam. The Prophet said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish, came to him. And they sent to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had someone. When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal escaped and joined Abu Basir till a band of them collected.",

            " Allahs Apostle set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya, and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, \"Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.\" By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniya through which one would go to them. The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, \"Al-Qaswa has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa has become stubborn!\" The Prophet said, \"Al-Qaswa has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.\" Then he said, \"By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.\" The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit containing a little water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to Allahs Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al- Khuzai came with some persons from his tribe Khuzaa and they were the advisers of Allahs Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, \"I left Kab bin Luai and Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.\" Allahs Apostle said, \"We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people, and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.\" Budail said, \"I will inform them of what you have said.\" So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, \"We have come from that man whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to you if you should like.\" Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said, \"Relate what you heard him saying.\" Budail said, \"I heard him saying so-and-so,\" relating what the Prophet had told him. Urwa bin Masud got up and said, \"O people! Arent you the sons? They said, \"Yes.\" He added, \"Am I not the father?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do you mistrust me?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Dont you know that I invited the people of Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well, this man has offered you a reasonable proposal, youd better accept it and allow me to meet him.\" They said, \"You may meet him.\" So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, \"O Muhammad! Wont you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, by Allah, I do not see dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.\" Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, \"Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?\" Urwa said, \"Who is that man?\" They said, \"He is Abu Bakr.\" Urwa said to Abu Bakr, \"By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.\" Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophets beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shuba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say, \"Remove your hand from the beard of Allahs Apostle.\" Urwa raised his head and asked, \"Who is that?\" The people said, \"He is Al-Mughira bin Shuba.\" Urwa said, \"O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?\" Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took their property and came to embrace Islam. The Prophet said. Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allahs Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, \"O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An- Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect.\" Urwa added, \"No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it.\" A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, \"Allow me to go to him,\" and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allahs Apostle said, \"He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn. So, bring the Budn in front of him.\" So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, \"Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Kaba.\" When he returned to his people, he said, I saw the Budn garlanded and marked. I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Kaba.\" Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, \"Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.\" Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, \"Now the matter has become easy.\" Suhail said to the Prophet \"Please conclude a peace treaty with us.\" So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, \"Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" Suhail said, \"As for Beneficent, by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously.\" The Muslims said, \"By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" The Prophet said, \"Write: By Your Name O Allah.\" Then he dictated, \"This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allahs Apostle has concluded.\" Suhail said, \"By Allah, if we knew that you are Allahs Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: \"Muhammad bin Abdullah.\" The Prophet said, \"By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.\" \" The Prophet said to Suhail, \"On the condition that you allow us to visit the House so that we may perform Tawaf around it.\" Suhail said, \"By Allah, we will not so as not to give chance to the Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year.\" So, the Prophet got that written. Then Suhail said, \"We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.\" The Muslims said, \"Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, \"O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.\" The Prophet said, \"The peace treaty has not been written yet.\" Suhail said, \"I will never allow you to keep him.\" The Prophet said, \"Yes, do.\" He said, \"I wont do.: Mikraz said, \"We allow you.\" Abu Jandal said, \"O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Dont you see how much I have suffered?\" : -3.891:. Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"I went to the Prophet and said, Arent you truly the Apostle of Allah? The Prophet said, Yes, indeed. I said, Isnt our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust? He said, Yes. I said, Then why should we be humble in our religion? He said, I am Allahs Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious. I said, Didnt you tell us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it? He said, Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Kaba this year? I said, No. He said, So you will visit it and perform Tawaf around it? \" Umar further said, \"I went to Abu Bakr and said, O Abu Bakr! Isnt he truly Allahs Prophet? He replied, Yes. I said, Then why should we be humble in our religion? He said, Indeed, he is Allahs Apostle and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right. I said, Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it? He said, Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the Kaba this year? I said, No. He said, \"You will go to Kaba and perform Tawaf around it.\" When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allahs Apostle said to his companions, \"Get up and slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.\" By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the peoples attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, \"O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and dont say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.\" So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came ; and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses: \"O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them.\" Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaiya married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said, \"Abide by the promise you gave us.\" So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, \"By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.\" The other drew it out and said, \"By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried it many times.\" Abu Basir said, \"Let me have a look at it.\" When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allahs Apostle saw him he said, \"This man appears to have been frightened.\" When he reached the Prophet he said, \"My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.\" Abu Basir came and said, \"O Allahs Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them, but Allah has saved me from them.\" The Prophet said, \"Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only have supporters.\" When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for promising that whoever came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet sent for them and Allah I revealed the following Divine Verses: \"And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts. the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance.\" And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess that he was the Prophet of Allah and refused to write: \"In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,\" and they prevented them from visiting the House.",

On that, Abu Bakr said, \"Allahs Apostle said, \"Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of Muhammad can eat of this property. By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allahs Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allahs Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allahs Apostle used to do.\" So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect Ali much, but after her death, Ali noticed a change in the peoples attitude towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months. Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, \"Come to us, but let nobody come with you,\" as he disliked that Umar should come, Umar said, \"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone \" Abu Bakr said, \"What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said, \"We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allahs Apostle.\" Thereupon Abu Bakrs eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allahs Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allahs Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that Ali said to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.\" So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then Ali and praying for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakrs right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. Ali added, \"But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair and that he did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, \"You have done the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with Ali as he returned to what the people had done.",

He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when they came, he said: O Banu An-Najjar, name me a price for this grove of yours. They said: By Allah, we will not ask for its price except from Allah.\" Anas said: \"In there were graves of idolators, ruins and date-palm trees. The Messenger of Allah ordered that the graves of the idolators be dug up, the ruins be leveled and the date-palm trees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the walls facing the Qiblah. The stone pillars were built at the sides of its gate. They started to move the stones, reciting some lines of verse, and the Messenger of Allah was with them when they were saying: O Allah! There is no good except the good of the Hereafter. So bestow victory on the Ansar and the Muhajirin.\"",

            "For the whole year I had the desire to ask Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. \"O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?\" He said, \"They were Hafsa and Aisha.\" Then I said to him, \"By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you.\" Umar said, \"Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge, ask me; and if I know, I will tell you.\" Then Umar added, \"By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, \"I recommend that you do so-and-so.\" I said to her, \"What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?\" She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You dont want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allahs Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!\" Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, \"O my daughter! Do you argue with Allahs Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?\" H. afsa said, \"By Allah, we argue with him.\" Umar said, \"Know that I warn you of Allahs punishment and the anger of Allahs Apostle. O my daughter! Dont be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allahs Apostle for her.\" Umar addled, \"Then I went out to Um Salamas house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allahs Apostle and his wives! By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her. At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, \"Open Open! I said, Has the king of Ghassan come? He said, No, but something worse; Allahs Apostle has isolated himself from his wives. I said, Let the nose of Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust! Then I put on my clothes and went to Allahs Apostles residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allahs Apostle was on the first step. I said to him, Say Umar bin Al-Khattab is here. Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Allahs Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allahs Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said. Why are you weeping? I replied, \"O Allahs Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life while you, Allahs Apostle though you are, is living in destitute\". The Prophet then replied.

Umar went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, \"O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: If you two turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined?\" He said, \"I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.\" Then Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, \"I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave him throughout the day till the night. The scared me and I said to her, Whoever has done so will be ruined! Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night? She said, Yes. I said, You are a ruined losing person! Dont you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allahs Apostle and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.\" Umar added,\"At that time a talk was circulating among us that Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said, Today a great thing has happened. I asked, What is it? Have Ghassan come? He said, No, but is greater and more horrifying than that: Allahs Apostle; has divorced his wives. Umar added, \"The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said \"Hafsa is a ruined loser. I had already thought that most probably this would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all? She said, I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room. I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, Will you get the permission for Umar? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying, I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet. Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave, Will you get the permission for Umar? He went in and returned saying, I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet. So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, Will you get the permission for Umar? He went in and returned to me saying, I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet. When I was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, The Prophet has given you permission. Then I entered upon Allahs Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, O Allahs Apostle! Have you divorced your wives? He looked at me and said, No. I said, Allah Akbar! And then, while still standing, I said chatting, Will you heed what I say, O Allahs Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men were overpowered by their women. The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, Will you heed what I say, O Allahs Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, \"Do not be tempted to imitate your companion, for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet. \" The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, O Allahs Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have been given, although they do not worship Allah. Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world. I said, O Allahs Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me. Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to Aisha. The Prophet had said, I will not enter upon them for one month, because of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon Aisha. Aisha said to him, O Allahs Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one. The Prophet said, The month is of twenty nine days. Aisha added, Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him. Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what Aisha had said. \" The Prophet, had decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one month. See Quran: ",

I then walked along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the wives of Allahs Messenger who backed up one another? He said: They were Hafsa and Aisha. I said to him: It is for one year that I intended to ask you about this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for you. He said: Dont do that. If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that. And if I were to know that, I would inform you. He stated that Umar had said: By Allah, during the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalt- ed revealed about them what He has revealed, and appointed for them what he appointed. He said: It so happened that I was thinking about some matter that my wife said: I wish you had done that and that. I said to her: It does not concern you and you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to do. She said to me: How strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon you, whereas your daughter retorts upon Allahs Messenger until he spends the day in vexation. Umar said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of my house until I visited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, that you retort upon Allahs Messenger until he spends the day in vexation, whereupon Hafsa said: By Allah, we do retort upon him. I said: You should bear in mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah and the wrath of His Messenger. You may not be misled by one whose beauty has fascinated her, and the love of Allahs Messenger for her. I then visited Umm Salama because of my relationship with her and I talked to her. Umm Salama said to me: Umar b. al-Khattab, how strange is it that you meddle with every matter so much so that you are anxious to interfere between Allahs Messenger and his wives, and this perturbed me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar. When I had been absent he used to bring me the news and when he had been absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of Ghassan. It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted by him. My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open it, open it. I said: Has the Ghassani come? He said: more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah has separated himself from his wives. I said: Let the nose of Hafsa and Aisha be besmeared with dust. I then took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allahs Messenger in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of date-palm, and the servant of Allahs Messenger who was black had been sitting at the end of the ladder. I said: This is Umar. So permission was granted to me. I narrated this news to Allahs Messenger and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama, Allahs Messenger smiled. He was lying on the mat and there was nothing between him and that, and under his head there was a pillow made of leather and it was stuffed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree and near his head there was hanging a hide.

He further said: And my house was situated in the suburb of Aledina in the tribe of Banu Umayya b. Zaid. One day I became angry with my wife and she retorted upon me. I did not like that she should retort upon me. She said: You disapprove of my retorting upon you By Allah, the wives of Allahs Apostle retort upon him, and one of them detaches herself from him for the day until the night.

So do not retort upon Allahs Messenger and do not ask him for anything, but ask me that which you desire, of your companion may not mislead you, if she is more graceful and is dearer to Allahs Messenger than you. He said: I had a compalaion from the Ansar and, we used to remain in the company of the Messenger turn by turn.

When it was dawn I observed the dawn prayer and dressed myself, and then came there and visited Hafsa, and she was weeping. I said: Has Allahs Messenger divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has, however, separated himself in his attic. I came to a black servant and said to him: Seek permission for Umar.

I was about to turn back when the boy called me and said: Go in; permission has been granted to you. I went in and greeted Allahs Messenger and he was reclining against the couch of mat and it had left its marks upon his side. I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives?

Messenger of Allah, I wish if you had seen how we the people of Quraish had domination over women but when we came to Medina we found people whom their women dominated. So our women began to learn from their women. One dily I became angry with my wife and she began to retort upon me. I did not approve that she should retort upon me. She said: You do not like that I should retort upon you, but, by Allah. the wives of Allahs Apostle retort upon him and any one of them separates herself from him for a day until night. I said: He who did that amongst them in fact failed and incurred loss. Does any of them feel sate from the wrath of Allahupon her due to the wrath of Allahs Messenger, and she has certainly perished.

Allahs Messenger smiled for the second time. I said: Allahs Messenger, way I talk to you about agreeable things? He said: Yes. I sat down and lifted my head in the house and, by Allah, I did not see anything significant besides three hides. I said: Messenger of Allah, supplicate the Lord that He should make prosperous for your Ummah as He has made plentiful for the people of Persia and Rome that they do no, worship Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, whereupon he sat up an I then said: Ibn Khattab, do you doubt that they are a nation whom their nice things have been given immediately in the life of this world. I said: Allahs Messenger! seek pardon for me. And he had taken an oath that he would not visit them for a month due to extreme annoyance with them until Allah showed His displeasure to him.

I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath that you would not visit us for a month, while you have visited after I have counted only twenty-nine. Thereupon he said: The month may also be of twenty-nine. He then said: Aisha, I am going to talk to you about a matter, and you should not be hasty in it until you have consulted your parents. He then recited this verse to me:\" O Prophet, say to your wives\" till he reached\" mighty reward\". Aisha said: By Allah, he knew that my parents would not allow me to separate from him.

On that, Abu Bakr said, \"Allahs Apostle said, \"Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of Muhammad can eat of this property. By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allahs Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allahs Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allahs Apostle used to do.\" So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect Ali much, but after her death, Ali noticed a change in the peoples attitude towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months. Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, \"Come to us, but let nobody come with you,\" as he disliked that Umar should come, Umar said, \"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone \" Abu Bakr said, \"What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said, \"We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allahs Apostle.\" Thereupon Abu Bakrs eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allahs Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allahs Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that Ali said to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.\" So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then Ali and praying for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakrs right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. Ali added, \"But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair and that he did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, \"You have done the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with Ali as he returned to what the people had done.",

If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense.

The fifth one said: My husband is a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.

The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise. He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara. How fine Abu Zara is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate.

As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara.

He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat. And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself.

As for the slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the slavegirl of Abu Zar?

Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, Eat, O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.\" She added, \"Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Abu Zars.\" Aisha then said: Allahs Apostle said to me, \"I am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.\"",

He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious.

As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara.

            "My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away. The second one said: My husband that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow. If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense. The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama, neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise. He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara. How fine Abu Zara is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara.

            "My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away. The second one said: My husband that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow. If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense. The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama, neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise. He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara. How fine Abu Zara is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara. Aisha reported that Allahs Messenger said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara was for Umm Zara. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Hisham b.

He does not ask about whatever is in the house.\" The sixth one said, \"If my husband eats, he eats too much, and if he drinks he leaves nothing; if he sleeps he sleeps he rolls himself ; and he does not insert his palm to inquire about my feelings.\" The seventh one said, \"My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.\" The eighth one said, \"My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab.\" The ninth one said, \"My husband is a tall generous man wearing a long strap for carrying his sword.

He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat. And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain.

As for the slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our house.\" The eleventh lady added, \"One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, Eat, O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.\" She added, \"Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Abu Zars.\" Aisha then said: Allahs Apostle said to me, \"I am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.\"",

He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat. And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain. Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I drink water, I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of her husbands other wife. As for the slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our house.\" The eleventh lady added, \"One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, Eat, O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.\" She added, \"Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Abu Zars.\" Aisha then said: Allahs Apostle said to me, \"I am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.\"",

Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand.

            "My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away. The second one said: My husband that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow. If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense. The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama, neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise. He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara. How fine Abu Zara is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara. Aisha reported that Allahs Messenger said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara was for Umm Zara. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Hisham b.

The other replied, It is in the well of Dharwan. \" So, the Prophet went out towards the well and then returned and said to me on his return, \"Its date-palms are like the heads of the devils.\" I asked, \"Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?\" He said, \"No, for I have been cured by Allah and I am afraid that this action may spread evil amongst the people.\" Later on the well was filled up with earth.",

He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me.

She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara.

The second one said: My husband that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow. If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense. The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama, neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise. He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara. How fine Abu Zara is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning and drink to my hearts content. The mother of Abu Zara, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara! Her bundles are heavily packed and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others. She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully. And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara went out when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates under her vest. He divorced me and married that woman met on the way. I later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara, make use of everything and send forth to your parents is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara.
