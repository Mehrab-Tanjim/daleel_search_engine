You know that I had a laborer who worked for me for one Faraq of rice, but he departed, leaving it. I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows. Later on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said, Go to those cows and drive them away. He said to me, But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice, I said to him, Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq. So he drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the rock. The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them drink unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting till it dawned. O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock. So the rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The one said, O Allah! You know that I had a cousin who was most beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars. So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. I got up and left the hundred Dinars. O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they came out.\" [It has been flasely argued that \"This Hadith indicates that one can ONLY ask Allah for help directly or through his performed good deeds.\" [In fact this hadith does account the request of those three men based on their good deeds, but nowhere within this hadiths text is it mentioned - as claimed - that this is the ONLY way that Allah may be asked. The reader is requested to review our holy Prophets words for himself, and not to allow others to falsely interject their own opinions in them. [It has also been wrongly added that \"But to ask Allah through dead or absent prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it is a kind of disbelief.\" Such statements are extremely inflamatory and un-islamically accusative. They purport to deny intercession, even though it was affirmed by the majority of Muslim scholars. The authentis hadeeth where one of the the Companions asks the Prophet: \"I ask you to be in your company in Jannah\" is enough proof for the wise.

Allah has made fasting it obligatory and spending its nights in prayer a voluntary act. Whoever draws close (to Allah) during it by doing a good deed will be like one who did an obligatory deed in any other month, and the one who does an obligatory deed in it will be like one who did seventy obligatory deeds in any other month. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. It is the month of helping others. It is a month in which the believer\u2019s provision is increased. Whoever gives a fasting person food with which to break his fast will have his sins forgiven and he will be ransomed from the Fire, and he will have a reward like his without it detracting from his reward in the slightest.",

Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them. But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called \"Manat\" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram, would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.

            " Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Allahs Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, \"Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr said, \"My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad- Daghna said, \"A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled, provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home.\" Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, \"A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?\" So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghnas guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, \"Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.\" Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Quran aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Quran there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Quran. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, \"We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Quran in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakrs public declaration of Islam. Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, \"You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect it.\" Abu Bakr said, \"I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with Allahs protection.\" At that time Allahs Apostle was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, \"Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two,Harras.\" So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Allahs Apostle said to him, \"Wait, for I expect to be permitted to emigrate.\" Abu Bakr asked, \"May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?\" Allahs Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order to accompany Allahs Apostle and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months.",

(The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the ruqyah said, \u2018Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and see what he tells us to do.\u2019 So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, \u2018How did you know that it (al-Faatihah) is a ruqyah?\u2019 Then he added, \u2018You have done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share too.\u2019 And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled.",

Then she asked him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do this?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Ibraaheem went on his way.
