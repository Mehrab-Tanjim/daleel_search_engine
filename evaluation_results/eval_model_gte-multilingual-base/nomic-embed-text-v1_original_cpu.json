Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" The Prophet said,      \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?\"      They said, \"No, O Allah's Apostle.\" He said, \"Do you have any      difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?\" They said,      \"No, O Allah's Apostle.\" He said, \"So you will see Him, like that.      Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say,      'Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that      thing),' so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and      whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to      worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities.      And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its      hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come      to them and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will (deny Him and) say, 'We      will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will      recognize Him.' So Allah will come to them in His appearance which      they know, and will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our     Lord,' so they will follow Him.      Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)' I and my followers will     be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day      except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day      will be, 'O Allah, save! Save!' In Hell (or over The Bridge) there      will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa'dan (thorny plant). Have you      seen As-Sa'dan? \" They replied, \"Yes, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"So     those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa'dan, but none knows how big      they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according     to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed)      because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the      hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then      relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He      will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then     order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship     none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to      and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be      worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by      the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat      up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah      has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come      out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life      will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed      that comes in the mud of the torrent.      Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will      remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person      among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, 'O my Lord!      Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and     its severe heat has burnt me.' So he will invoke Allah in the way      Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, 'If I      grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply,      'No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.' He      will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand.      So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face      Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah      will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, 'O my Lord! Bring me      near to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will say to him, 'Didn't you give     your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more     than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam's son! How      treacherous you are!' He will say, 'O my lord,' and will keep on      invoking Allah till He says to him, 'If I give what you are asking,      will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, 'No, by Your      (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.'     Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will      bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of      Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will      see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long      as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my      Lord! Admit me into Paradise.' Allah will say, 'Didn't you give your      covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than      what you had been given?' Allah will say, 'Woe on you, O Adam's son!      How treacherous you are! '      The man will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of      Your creation,' and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will      laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of      him, He will say to him, 'Enter Paradise,' and when he will enter it,      Allah will say to him, 'Wish for anything.' So he will ask his Lord,      and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will      remind him to wish for certain things by saying, '(Wish for)      so-and-so.' When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say,      'This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well.\"     'Ata' bin Yazid added: Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu      Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira      said that Allah had said, \"That is for you and its equal as well,\" Abu     Sa'id Al-Khudri said, \"And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!\" Abu      Huraira said, \"I do not remember, except his saying, 'That is for you      and its equal as well.'\" Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri then said, \"I testify      that I remember the Prophet saying, 'That is for you, and ten times as     much.'

On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, \"Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.\" Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?' They will say, 'O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.' They will be directed and addressed thus, 'Will you drink,' whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.'

He then said \u201cWhen you meet the polytheists who are your enemy, summon them tone of three things and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and refrain from them. Summon them to Islam and if they agree, accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to leave their territory and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants and tell them that if they do so, they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants, but if they refuse and choose their own abode, tell them that they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims subject to Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand jizyah (poll tax) from them, if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. But if they refuse, seek Alaah\u2019s help and fight with them. When you invade the fortress and they (its people) offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction, do not grant this, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on Allaah\u2019s jurisdiction regarding them. But let them capitulate and have the matter refereed to your jurisdiction and make a decision about them later on as you wish.Sufyan (bin \u2018Uyainah) said thah \u2018Alqamah said \u201cI mentioned this tradition to Muqatil bin Habban, He said \u201cMuslim narrated it to me.\u201d Abu Dawud said \u201cHe is Ibn Haidam narrated from Al Nu\u2019man in Muqqarin from the Prophet (\ufdfa) like the tradition of Sulaiman bin Buraidah.",

(2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.\" `Aisha said, \"O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called \"Manat\" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, \"O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.\" So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' \" Aisha added, \"Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.\" Later on I (`Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman (of `Aisha's narration) and he said, 'I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom `Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka`ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: \"Verily As-Safa and Al- Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.\" Abu Bakr said, \"It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka`ba.'",

Another kind of marriage was that a man asked his wife when she became pure from menstruation to send fro so and so and have sexual intercourse with him. Her husband kept himself aloof and did not have intercourse with her till It became apparent that she was pregnant from the man who had intercourse with her. When it was manifest that she was pregnant, her husband approached her if he liked. This marriage was called istibda\u2019(to utilize man for intercourse for a noble birth). A third kind of marriage was that a group of people less than ten in number entered upon a woman and had intercourse with her. When she conceived gave birth to a child and a number of days passed after her delivery, she sent for them. No one of them could refuse to attend and they gathered before her. She said to them \u201cYou have realized your affair. I have now given birth to a child. And this is your son.  O so and so. She called the name of anyone of them she liked and the child was attributed to him. A fourth kind of marriage was that many people gathered together and entered upon a woman who did not prevent anyone who came to her. They were prostitutes. They hoisted flags at their doors which served as a sign for the one who intended to enter upon them. When she became pregnant and delivered the child , they got together before her and called for the experts of tracing relationship from physical features. They attributed the child to whom they considered and it was given to him. The child was called his son and he could not deny. When Allah sent Muhammad (\ufdfa) as a Prophet, he abolished all kinds of marriages prevalent among the people of the pre Islamic times except of the Muslims practiced today.",

On that, Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Apostle said, \"Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.' By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah's Apostle used to do.\" So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband `Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect `Ali much, but after her death, `Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him. So `Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. `Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). `Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, \"Come to us, but let nobody come with you,\" as he disliked that `Umar should come, `Umar said (to Abu Bakr), \"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone \" Abu Bakr said, \"What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then `Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), \"We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah's Apostle .\" Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allah's Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah's Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that `Ali said to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.\" So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of `Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then `Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. `Ali added, \"But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, \"You have done the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with `Ali as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).",

On that, Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Apostle said, \"Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.' By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah's Apostle used to do.\" So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima.

When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect `Ali much, but after her death, `Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him. So `Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. `Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). `Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, \"Come to us, but let nobody come with you,\" as he disliked that `Umar should come, `Umar said (to Abu Bakr), \"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone \" Abu Bakr said, \"What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then `Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), \"We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah's Apostle .\" Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears.

But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah's Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that `Ali said to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.\" So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of `Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then `Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. `Ali added, \"But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, \"You have done the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with `Ali as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).",

Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\"     At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Apostle said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months.     One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Apostle with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!\" The Prophet said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!\" Allah's Apostle said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts).     Then Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.",

' (2.240) Ibn `Abbas said: The above Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the 'Iddah at her late husband's house, and so she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she likes. And Allah says: 'Without turning them out.' 'Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the 'Iddah at her husband's house, and live there according to her (husband's) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of her husband's house) as Allah says: 'There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.' (2.240) 'Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the widow) was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she would like, and she was no longer entitled to be accommodated by her husband's family.",

            "Narrated Mujahi:                     (regarding the Verse):-- \"Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They - (their wives) -- shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).\" (2.234) The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband's family, so Allah revealed: \"Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year's maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.' (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240). So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband's home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says: \"..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.\" So the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her. 'Ata said: Ibn `Abbas said, \"This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: \"..without turning them out..\" cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband's house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes.\" 'Ata's aid: If she wished, she could complete her 'Idda by staying in her dead husband's residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah's Statement:-- \"There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.\" `Ata' added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband's house), so she could complete the 'Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow's) dwelling in her dead husband's house and she could complete the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah's Statement says:--\"...without turning them out...\"",

He said: Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had cursed and those who were mentioned in Allah's Book ? She said: I have read it from cover to cover and have not found in it. He said: I swear by Allah, if you read it, you would have found it. He then read: What the Apostle has brought you accept, and what he has forbidden refrain from it. She said: I find some of these thing in you wife. He said: Enter (the house) and see. She said: I then entered (the house) and came out. He asked: What did you see ? She said: I did not see (anything). He said: Had it been so, she would have not have been with us.

The intelligent man should have insight into the era in which he lives, focus on his own affairs and guard his tongue. Whoever regards his words as being among his deeds will speak little and will only speak about what concerns him.' I [Abu Dharr] said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Moosa?

'Uthman said to the three Quraish men: 'In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the (recitation dialect of the) Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish for it was in their tongue.'
